					<h3>I have tried 2 different schools within almost 5 years here in Florida. I have to say that Taekwondo Athletic Center is by far most the BEST taekwondo training school. He has respect, discipline, honesty , value for his students and for his teachings. If you really want to be a great taekwondo Athlete he is the best teacher. He makes you understand that if you want to be the best you have to push yourself and he will guide you to be the best. His athletes show respect for each other and that is a great thing for all fighters and athletes to understand and learn. I am going for my black belt soon and I am proud to be his black belt over any other taekwondo instructor. He also has so much dedication to his students that I have never noticed before in ANY other instructor You can tell he does this for his students more than himself. That is an instructor you want to make you the best you can be. Go beyond limits you ever thought were possible! The best part is that he is not a belt factory. He REALLY makes you earn it and that is the best feeling in the world a martial artist can feel and know thy really did earn and it wasn't just because they paid a tuition. Come try it out and you will understand!</h3>
